%  The pack­age is a tool­box of pro­gram­ming fa­cil­i­ties geared pri­mar­ily to­wards LaTeX class and pack­age au­thors. It pro­vides LaTeX fron­tends to some of the new prim­i­tives pro­vided by e-TeX as well as some generic tools which are not strictly re­lated to e-TeX but match the pro­file of this pack­age. Note that the ini­tial ver­sions of this pack­age were re­leased un­der the name ela­tex.
% The pack­age pro­vides func­tions that seem to of­fer al­ter­na­tive ways of im­ple­ment­ing some LaTeX ker­nel com­mands; nev­er­the­less, the pack­age will not mod­ify any part of the LaTeX ker­nel.

% The package defines commands that switch according to the prevailing ‘draft’ or ‘final’ options; each command takes two arguments, the first for the ‘true’, the second for the ‘false’ case. Commands are:
%   \ifdraft determines whether we're operating in draft (‘true’) or final mode;
%   \ifoptiondraft determines whether a ‘draft’ option has been given; and
%   \ifoptionfinal determines whether a ‘final’ option has been given.
\RequirePackage{ifdraft}

% This pack­age of­fers sup­port for pack­age au­thors who want to use op­tions in key-value for­mat for their pack­age op­tions.
% The pack­age is part of the oberdiek bun­dle.
