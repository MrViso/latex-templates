% FILL IN YOUR THESIS DATA HERE                                                %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Provide your thesis title here. Make sure that you capitalize all the important words (both in English and German) but leave words such as "be", "a", "with", "an", "but", "ohne", "mit", "von", "auf" in lowercase
%\title{This Shall be a Great Thesis Paper with an Extremely Long Title but who Cares}

% Got a subtitle? Make this a regular sentence not following the rules for the \title
%\subtitle{Some theses even have subtitles}

% Provide the date your document was printed. Either you use ```\today``` here to print in the current date (which should be done during drafting) or you pop in the actual date (when your thesis is finally being submitted). To make this command work properly, please refer to the isodate package documentation. In short: this class requires you to type either ```\today``` or ```\printdate{YYYY-MM-DD}``` to make typsetting the date work as expected.
%\date{2015-08-28}

% The author's name or authors' names. If multiple authors are given, separate them with ```\and```. Currently, this does not work properly with the \DeclarationOfAuthorship, but on the other hand this is only needed for student theses where there should be only one author nonetheless
%\author{Maschinen Bauer}

% Your matriculation number (only needed for student theses)
%\matriculation{1234567}

% Name of the examiner assessing your thesis (NO ```\and``` here)
%\examiner{Jun.-Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Andreas Pott}

% Your major that you are studying (do not put Master or Bachelor or antyhing like that here. This is automatically determined by the document type e.g., "bachelor" or "master")
%\major{Technische Kybernetik}

% List of supervisors here. Multiple superviors must be separated by 
%\supervisor{Dipl.-Ing.\@ Philipp Tempel \and Dipl.-Ing.\@ Michael Neubauer}

% If your work was done with a partner, provide its name here (however they are called). It will be typeset after the department's name
%\partner{Fraunhofer IPA}

% To provide a logo of the partner (on the coverpage), overwrite the \partnerlogo macro to the path of the partner's logo (only the path, nothing else).
% NOTE: Currently there is no use for using this because there is no cover page
%\renewcommand{\partnerlogo}{images/logo/simtech}
