# ISW LaTeX Templates

This is the repository for LaTeX document templates for student theses, reports, and other documents.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure may not be apparent at first sight, thus we shall briefly introduce the folders in use

### Backlog

Local folder for backlog storing of files like other university's or department's templates. Folder shall not contain any commited data and exists solely for the purpose of local i.e., development backlog.

### Documentation

All documentation for packages used by the LaTeX class ```isw.cls``` can be found in `Documentation`. Though documentation can be found on CTAN, too, it is hosted here for better packaging of the file

### Implementation

Actual implementation of the templates for ```thesis``` and ```presentation```.

#### Thesis
Working/development directory for the document template in LaTeX.

#### Presentation
Working/development directory for the presentation template in LaTeX.

## Development Team

ISW LaTeX Templates was created by [Philipp Tempel](http://www.isw.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/mitarbeiter/Tempel/?__locale=en) who both uses and continues to develop the template.
